# 000017 — worktree-docs/update-agents-md

**Agent:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-4-6) @ prism branch worktree-docs/update-agents-md

## Intent

Update AGENTS.md to reflect the current state of the project.

## What Changed

2026-02-20T12:08-08:00 AGENTS.md — updated Current Project Status: phase header, test counts, added M10 glTF and mobile orbit drag to "What works", removed glTF from "What's next" (already done), added Flutter Desktop as next milestone
2026-02-20T12:08-08:00 AGENTS.md — fixed stale "WgpuRenderer (in progress)" label in Architecture section — it's been complete since M2
2026-02-20T12:08-08:00 AGENTS.md — added PR Submission Checklist section under Contribution Guidelines; renamed "Random Notes" to "Agent Notes"

## Decisions

2026-02-20T12:08-08:00 Added PR Submission Checklist as a new subsection — it consolidates format + CI requirements in one scannable place, reducing ambiguity for agents creating PRs
2026-02-20T12:08-08:00 Added Flutter Desktop to "What's next" — user confirmed this is the next planned feature

## Issues

None.
