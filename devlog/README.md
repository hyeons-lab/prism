# Development Log (devlog)

This folder contains a chronological record of development sessions with Claude Code. Each file documents changes, decisions, research, and reasoning from a single working session.

## Purpose

- **Recoverability:** Track what changed, why, and when
- **Timeline:** Create a narrative of decisions and discoveries
- **Multi-agent coordination:** Record which agents worked on what, with which models
- **Context preservation:** Maintain "why" reasoning, not just "what" changes

## File Naming Convention

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_<sequence>.md`

- Example: `2026-02-14_01.md`
- Sequence number (`01`, `02`, ...) handles multiple sessions per day
- Files sort chronologically by default

## Reading the Log

- **Newest files = most recent work**
- Each file is a self-contained session narrative
- Check the Agents table to see who (and which model) made changes
- Intent section explains the "why" behind the work

These files are version-controlled and part of the repository history.
