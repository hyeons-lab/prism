# Development Log (devlog)

This folder contains a chronological record of development sessions with Claude Code. Each file documents changes, decisions, research, and reasoning from a single day's work.

## Purpose

- **Recoverability:** Track what changed, why, and when
- **Timeline:** Create a narrative of decisions and discoveries
- **Multi-agent coordination:** Record which agents worked on what, with which models
- **Context preservation:** Maintain "why" reasoning, not just "what" changes
- **Avoid repeating mistakes:** Failed attempts and lessons learned are logged

## File Naming

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` — **one file per day**.
- Example: `2026-02-14.md`
- Multiple sessions on the same day use `## Session N — Topic` headers within the file
- Files sort chronologically by default

## Reading the Log

- **Newest files = most recent work**
- Each file contains one or more sessions, separated by `---` dividers
- Session headers include the topic, start time, and model used
- Check the Agent line to see who (and which model) made changes
- Intent section explains the "why" behind the work
- Issues section contains lessons learned and failed approaches

These files are version-controlled and part of the repository history.
